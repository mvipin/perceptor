# Speed Zone Mask Configuration for Nav2 Speed Filter
# This file defines the speed limit zones for the Perceptor robot
#
# TRINARY MODE: Converts grayscale pixels to 3 discrete OccupancyGrid values
# Black pixels (0) → OccupancyGrid 0 (free) → Slow speed zones
# White pixels (255) → OccupancyGrid 100 (occupied) → Fast speed zones
# Gray pixels (90-166) → OccupancyGrid -1 (unknown) → Medium speed zones
